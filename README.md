# Proposal
<p class="c8 c5"><span class="c3 c5"></span></p><p class="c5 c6"><span class="c4 c5">ML-Based Marine Spill Detector</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c3 c5"></span></p><p class="c20 c5"><span class="c3 c5">We propose an oil spill detection web application that periodically reads NASA satellite data and generates a global geographic heatmap. The purpose of the heatmap is to indicate the occurrence chance of the spillage incidents using regular deep learning methods. Our method mainly consists of combining open source datasets for the NASA Space Apps to help natural disasters decision makers plan and allocate resources efficiently. Our vision is to have the contamination accumulation in the food chain de-accelerated, and the mission of the public user interface (SaudiSpaceShuttle.com) is to provide the first responders community with an additional deep model as well as to increase the public awareness about water pollution. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">When it comes to water pollution, what goes around really comes around, since </span><span class="c7 c5">water pollution can put people at risk of diseases. </span><span class="c7">One of the most pressing sources of water pollution is the oil spill problems. Even though the challenge of monitoring sea pollution has been addressed by many organizations, the stakes are too high, and additional resources could make a difference to solve the </span><span class="c7 c5">accumulating</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;contamination in the food chain. There exist specialized monitoring organizations that use machine learning to reduce the impact of the oil spill. For instance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA for short, trains machine learning models to predict the trajectory of the oil spill spread. However, some spillages become irreversible within a couple of days after an oil tanker accident, and the negative effects from some types of oil could last for decades. </span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c3">Therefore, the problem statement is about providing an additional oil spill model to double check the safety of the marine resources. However, our machine learning model uses existing open data from governmental organizations. The approach we adopt to addressing the water pollution is providing heat maps that can be easily read by emergency responders and relevant decision makers. For the end user, the workflow is as friendly as entering the area of interest to the Saudi Space Shuttle web app and receiving the requested information or having it posted to the public. Nevertheless, the underlying modeling is moderately sophisticated. The everyday data acquisition, cleaning, clustering, and mapping are part of the processing method.</span></p><p class="c11 c5 c16"><span class="c7">In the ML-Based Marine Spill Detector, several pieces of open data are utilized, and two datasets are joined for extracting the main features for the marine oil-spill, chemical, and other incidents. The regular satellite imagery of the Earth API was prone to cloud blocking. Accordingly, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), from European Space Agency (ESA), which has a </span><span class="c7 c19"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency%23NASA&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1633489504725000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2w39frJhpoOh3NlFg43b8M">long-lasting partnership</a></span><span class="c7">&nbsp;with NASA, was practical since it is less variant to weather conditions, and so it has </span><span class="c7 c19"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/applications/mapping-applications-s1-modes&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1633489504725000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PLl0eZmS8G2qVTZ20H-p5">multiple applications</a></span><span class="c7">, one of which is oil pollution detection. In 2023, a new SAR addition is expected to be added by NASA&#39;s joint NASA ISRO SAR Mission (</span><span class="c7 c19"><a class="c1" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nisar.jpl.nasa.gov/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1633489504726000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ZtMURTEw--KDhgVOLiDWd">NISAR</a></span><span class="c7">) program. In any case, the ability of reading the satellite imagery and radar readings isn&#39;t adequate without the historical data of the marine pollution incidents. For that reason, the ESA dataset was joined with the Raw Incident Data, which is open and is accessible via the IncidentNews website of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In 2016. NASA launched an advanced weather satellite for NOAA.
