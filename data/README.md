The second version consisted of up to 12,055 postive samples for 908 unique incidents and up to 34,482 negative samples for 2,610 unique locations, between 2014 and 2021. Each sample was saved in JPEG format, capturing the available SAR-Sentinel-1 readings within a two-month span. The area captured in each data sample is 50km x 50km. The mode and the band of most of the readings are Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH), respectively.
