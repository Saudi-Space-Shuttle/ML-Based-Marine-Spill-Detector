The second version consists of up to 12,055 postive samples for 908 unique incidents and up to 34,482 negative samples for 2,610 unique locations, between 2014 and 2021. Each sample is saved in the grayscale JPEG format, sized 256px × 256px, capturing a 50km × 50km area of interest, from the available SAR-Sentinel-1 tiles, within a two-month span of each date of interest. The mode and the band of most of the readings are Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive (VV) and horizontal-horizontal (HH), respectively. The SSS_02_metadata.csv file specifies the elementwise details of the joint dataset. Similarly, the other CVS files list the images in each dataset. Additionally, the filename scheme contains variables, which are inbetween curly brackets and described below:



### 1. SSS_02_raw.zip

```
{label}_{incident}_{order}_POL{polarization}_LON{longitude}_LAT{latitude}_IMD{image_datetime}_IND{incident_date}.jpg
```

1. label: a. Positve labels: "Oil", "Chemical", and "Other" incidents. b. Negative labels: "NA" followed by the number of months. 
2. incident: unique for each location.
3. order: temporal order of images. Negative is for images that were taken after the date of interest.
4. polarization: polarization of the transmiter and recever. Usually VV or HH.
5. longitude and latitude: location of interest.
6. image_datetime: the date (year-month-day) and the time (hour-minutes) of the date of the image.
7. incident_date: the date of interest associated with the image.


### 2. SSS_02_delta.zip

```
{label}_{incident}_{order_of_first_image}_{order_of_second_image}.jpg
```

1. label: a. Positve labels: "Oil", "Chemical", and "Other" incidents. b. Negative labels: "NA" followed by the number of months. 
2. incident: unique for each location.
3. order: temporal order of images. Negative is for images that were taken after the date of interest.
More details can be looked up by finding the relevant two images in SSS_02_raw. The files were located using the included "sample_pairs.csv" file.

The first version consisted of about 1,050 samples between 2014 and 2021. Each sample was saved in gif format, capturing the available SAR-Sentinel-1 readings within a one month window span of the incident first report. The area captured in each data sample is 20km x 20km. The mode and the band of most of the readings are Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) and Single co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive (VV), respectively.
